👋 About Me
I am a Hardware Technician with a strong hands-on profile, focused on electronic board assembly, rework, and testing. My background is rooted in practical lab activities, where organization, precision, and process discipline are essential to deliver reliable results.
I am comfortable working with SMD and through-hole components, performing manual soldering and rework, and supporting prototyping activities. I value following technical instructions closely and documenting each step of the process, including failures, corrections, and test outcomes, to ensure traceability and continuous improvement.
In lab environments, I actively support engineers during diagnostics and validation stages, preparing tools, materials, and test setups to ensure smooth execution of development tasks. I am familiar with basic measurement instruments and bench testing routines, always prioritizing safety, ESD best practices, and workspace organization.
I am especially motivated by hardware development and R&D environments, where learning, iteration, and attention to detail directly impact product quality. My goal is to grow alongside experienced engineers, contribute consistently to the hardware development cycle, and help build robust products designed for scale.
